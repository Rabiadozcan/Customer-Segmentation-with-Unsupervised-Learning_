# Customer-Segmentation-with-Unsupervised-Learning_
Business Problem:
FLO wants to divide its customers into segments and determine marketing strategies according to these segments. To this end, customer behaviors will be defined and groups will be created according to clusters in these behaviors. With Unsupervised Learning methods (Kmeans, Hierarchical Clustering), customers are divided into clusters and their behaviors are desired to be observed.

20,000 observations, 13 variables * master_id: Unique customer number order_channel: Which channel is used for the shopping platform (Android, ios, Desktop, Mobile, Offline) last_order_channel: Channel where the last shopping was done first_order_date: Date of the customer's first shopping last_order_date: Date of the customer's last shopping last_order_date_online: Date of the customer's last shopping on the online platform last_order_date_offline: Date of the customer's last shopping on the offline platform order_num_total_ever_online: Total number of shoppings made by the customer on the online platform order_num_total_ever_offline: Total number of shoppings made by the customer offline customer_value_total_ever_offline: Total amount of shoppings paid by the customer offline customer_value_total_ever_offline: Total amount of shoppings paid by the customer offline interested_in_categories_12 : List of categories the customer has shopped in the last 12 months
